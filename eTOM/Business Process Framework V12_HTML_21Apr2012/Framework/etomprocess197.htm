Resource Strategy &amp; Planning processes develop resource strategies, policies and plans for the enterprise, based on the long-term business, market, product and service directions of the enterprise  These processes understand the capabilities of the existing enterprise infrastructure, capture the requirements on the infrastructure based on market, product and service strategies of the enterprise’, manage the capabilities of the suppliers and partners to develop and deliver new resource capabilities, and define the way that new or enhanced infrastructure may be deployed. 
<BR>Research &amp; analysis is performed to determine resource targets as well as strategies to reach the defined targets.  This research may be obtained from the external market and resource suppliers and partners, or developed internally through research programs and activities, or leverage of other internal knowledge.
