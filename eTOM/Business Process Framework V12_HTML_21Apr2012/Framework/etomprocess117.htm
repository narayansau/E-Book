<H2>(2) eTOM Process Type Audit Management</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.3.2.4</H3>
<H3>Category: (2) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Provide assurance to senior management and the enterprise Board that the enterprise processes and controls are effective and conform to relevant adopted standards.
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
Audit Management processes provide assurance to senior management and the enterprise Board that the enterprise operational processes and controls are effective and conform to relevant adopted standards (which may be externally imposed or internally adopted). Audit Management processes may be managed by external independent organizations, or by internal groups within the enterprise, but in either case are designed to support senior management/Board assurance. They can also be used proactively to develop risk assessment methodologies, scoring systems, and advice to operational groups who are responsible for the operations processes. However, the assurance role of the processes is more related to reactive assessment.
<BR>The processes identify, prioritize and manage audit programs, define the audit policies and procedures, assess operational activities to ensure necessary or mandated control structures are in place, and provide an estimate to the extent to which the procedures are followed and are effective. The processes ensure that appropriate reports relating to compliance and capability are provided to senior management/Board within appropriate defined timeframes. The processes define the audit approach to be used depending on the circumstances, as well as the risk assessment methodology and scoring approach to be used.
