<H3>Brief Description</H3>

<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The purpose of the Support Order Handling processes is twofold – to ensure that new and/or modified Order Handling related infrastructure is deployed effectively, and to ensure that Order Handling processes can operate effectively.
<BR>
<BR>For the Order Handling processes the role of the Support Order Handling processes is to make sure that there is sufficient process capacity and capability (for example information, materials, systems and resources) so that the Order Handling processes can operate effectively.Examples are information on how to process orders for specific product offerings, information needed to carry out designs, materials needed to confirm customer order requests, systems needed to validate product offering availability.
<BR>
<BR>The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:
<BR>
<BR>· forecasting at an operational level customer order handling volume requirements;
<BR>· the capacity planning associated with the deployment of new and/or modified customer order handling infrastructure;
<BR>· establishment and monitoring of organizational arrangements to support deployment and operation of new and/or modified customer order handling infrastructure;
<BR>· creation, deployment, modification and/or upgrading of customer order handling infrastructure deployment support tools (including Customer Inventory and Product Offer Inventory) and processes for new and/or modified customer order handling infrastructure;
<BR> · authoring, reviewing and approving operational procedures developed by Marketing &amp; Offer Management processes prior to customer order handling infrastructure deployment;
<BR>· the testing and acceptance of new and/or modified customer order handling infrastructure as part of the handover procedure from the Marketing &amp; Offer  Management processes to Operations;
<BR>· detecting customer order handling infrastructure operational limitations and/or deployment incompatibilities and providing requirements to address these aspects to Marketing &amp; Offer Management processes;
<BR>· co-ordination and roll-out, in accordance with approved plans, of the approved new and/or modified customer order handling infrastructure;
<BR>· monitoring capacity utilization of deployed customer order handling infrastructure to provide early detection of potential customer order handling infrastructure shortfalls;
<BR>· reconfiguration and re-arrangement of under-utilized deployed customer order handling infrastructure;
<BR>· managing recovery and/or removal of obsolete or unviable customer order handling infrastructure;
<BR>· reporting on deployed customer order handling infrastructure capacity;
<BR>· Tracking and monitoring of the customer order handling infrastructure deployment processes and costs (including where customer order handling infrastructure is deployed and managed by third parties),
<BR> · reporting on the capability of the customer order handling infrastructure deployment processes; and
<BR> · establishing and managing customer order handling notification facilities and lists to support the Order Handling notification and reporting processes
<BR>The processes undertake trend analysis on order handling, such as time taken to complete a customer order, frequency and type of Order Handling process issues involved, and cancelled orders.
