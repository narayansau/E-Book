The Operations Support &amp; Readiness process grouping is responsible for support to the &quot;FAB&quot; processes, and for ensuring operational readiness in the fulfillment, assurance and billing areas.

They reflect a need in some enterprises to divide their processes between the immediate customer-facing and real-time operations of FAB and other Operations processes which act as a &quot;second-line&quot; in carrying out the operational tasks. Not all enterprises will choose to employ this split, or to position the division in exactly the same place, so it is recognized that in applying the eTOM Business Framework in particular scenarios, the processes in Operations Support &amp; Readiness and in FAB may be merged for day-to-day operation.
