<H2>(3) eTOM Process Type Track &amp; Manage S/P Requisition</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.4.2.3</H3>
<H3>Category: (3) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Ensure S/P requisition orders are being processed and delivered efficiently and effectively
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The objective of the Track &amp; Manage S/P Requisition processes is to ensure S/P requisition orders are being processed and delivered efficiently and effectively, and that escalation is being invoked as required for any open S/P requisition orders in jeopardy.
<BR>
<BR>Responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:
<BR><ul><LI>Managing regular interaction with the supplier/partner to establish progress of S/P requisition orders;
<BR><LI>Modifying information in an existing S/P requisition order based on feedback of progress from the supplier/partner;
<BR><LI>Modifying the S/P requisition order status;
<BR><LI>Cancelling a S/P requisition order when the specific requisition requirements are no longer required as notified by the RM&amp;O, the SM&amp;O or the CRM processes; and
<BR><LI>Monitoring the jeopardy status of open S/P requisition orders, and initiating escalation of S/P requisition orders as necessary.
</ul>
<BR>
<BR>These processes track progress with the supplier/partner, either periodically, or at defined points according to a project or program plan. This tracking may be driven from the enterprise, or triggered by reports from the supplier/partner (e.g. periodically or at key events). These processes also initiate jeopardy and risk management in relation to the supplied specific resources, services and products, their availability and delivery schedule. 
<BR>
<BR>These processes also manage notifications or requests from suppliers regarding forced or requested changes to the S/P requisition specification or delivery schedule. These change requests may be caused by the supplier/partner or may be outside their control.  Change requests are notified to the originating RM&amp;O, SM&amp;O or CRM processes where a resolution is agreed.
<BR>
<BR>The Track &amp; Manage S/P Requisition processes will also inform the Close S/P Requisition Order processes by modifying the S/P requisition order status to completed when the S/P requisition has been successfully delivered.
