<H2>(3) eTOM Process Type Issue Resource Orders</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.3.2.8</H3>
<H3>Category: (3) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Issue correct and complete resource orders
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The purpose of the Issue Resource Orders processes is to issue correct and complete resource orders.
<BR>The resource orders may be required to satisfy pertinent service order information received, may arise as a result of requests for resource provisioning to satisfy resource trouble recovery activities, may arise to alleviate resource performance issues, or may arise as a result of information received from suppliers/partners in relations to specific resources.
<BR>These processes assess the information contained in the service order, through a resource order request, initiating resource process request or supplier/partner initiated request, to determine the associated resource orders that need to be issued.
<BR>The issued resource order may require a feasibility assessment to be undertaken, may require new provisioning activities for specific resources, may require a change to a previously issued resource order or may require the deletion/recovery of previously delivered specific resources.
<BR>Where the initiating request or service order has a standard set of associated resource orders, this process is responsible for issuing the resource orders, and for creating a record of the relevant initiating request or service order information and the associated resource orders.
<BR>Where the initiating request or service order has special or unusual requirements, and a specific feasibility assessment has not been previously undertaken, this process marks the issued resource order as requiring special handling, and passes management for further processing to the Track &amp; Manage Resource Provisioning process.
<BR>Where the initiating request or service order has special or unusual requirements, and a specific feasibility assessment has been previously undertaken, this process issues the previously determined resource orders.
<BR>The orchestration, if required, and tracking of the progress of a resource order is the responsibility of the Track &amp; Manage Resource Provisioning processes.
