<H2>(3) eTOM Process Type Manage Revenue Assurance Policy Framework</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.3.2.6.1</H3>
<H3>Category: (3) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Establish and manage a framework of policies and measurable controls that are used to manage the risk associated with revenue assurance
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The objective of the Manage Revenue Assurance Framework process is to establish and manage a framework of policies and measurable controls that are used to manage the risk associated with revenue assurance, and to optimise the enterprise’s appetite for revenue assurance risk.
<BR>These processes are responsible for, but not limited to:
<BR>·
<TAB>Establishing and managing a revenue assurance policy framework which is aligned with the overall enterprise goals and objectives;
<BR>·
<TAB>Developing a framework of controls and KPIs which achieves the defined revenue assurance goals and objectives
<BR>·
<TAB>Gaining enterprise-wide commitment to and knowledge of the framework; and
<BR>·
<TAB>Regularly reviewing the revenue assurance framework to ensure that its outcomes remain aligned with the enterprise’s objectives.
<BR>The Manage Revenue Assurance Framework process has a specific responsibility in developing and defining controls and Key Performance Indicators  (KPIs) used for RA, in conjunction with operational and other processes elsewhere in the enterprise. Where processes elsewhere in the enterprise have an intrinsic capability to instrument their own performance and behavior (as an aspect of operating effectively within the business), the Manage Revenue Assurance Framework process makes use of this capability, but can also provide guidance to these processes in the form of modified, or additional, KPIs, required to support the overall role of Revenue Assurance Management. This can involve individual process elements throughout the enterprise (as appropriate for the various aspects of Revenue Assurance Management that apply), or may involve co-ordination across a number of process elements where Revenue Assurance Management acts to provide an integrated or coordinated view of the overall situation. 
<BR>With regard to KPI definition, the Manage Revenue Assurance Framework process establishes the objectives used to identify the minimum level of satisfactory performance required for a given control point or a process from an RA perspective, and works with other process element in the enterprise to effect this.
<BR>With regard to development of Revenue Assurance controls, the Manage Revenue Assurance Framework process applies policy-based rules that represent the logical definition of comparisons performed on entities, such as bills and call detail records. These are used together with Revenue Assurance KPIs, to identify discrepancies from an RA perspective.
