Where Support S/P Problem Reporting &amp; Management processes are engaged to manage infrastructure-level problems, these processes are responsible to ensure on-time and correct resolution and recovery.

<BR>
<BR>The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:
<BR>
<BR> Arranging and managing supplier/partner access to appropriate service provider problem and/or trouble management support tools (including any appropriate Inventories) and processes;
