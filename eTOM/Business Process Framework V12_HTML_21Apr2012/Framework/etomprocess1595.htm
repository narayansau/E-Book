<H2>(3) eTOM Process Type Manage Work Order Lifecycle</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.3.7.9</H3>
<H3>Category: (3) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
A Work Order is an aggregation of jobs that are to be completed to achieve some business goal: to provide a customer service, to fix a problem, etc. Work Order Lifecycle Management processes are responsible for processing and monitoring the execution of a work order through its entire lifecycle, from issuance to closing. This includes, among other steps, validation, analysis, and decomposing a work order into work items, aggregating them, and assigning them to employees and/or third parties. These processes also detect problems with completing the work, and requesting Work Order reassignment to reallocate manual activities to solve the issue.
<BR>
<BR>It should be noted that the Work Order execution sub process (by a field technician) is not explicitly covered here, but rather its monitoring is the responsibility of the Track and Manage work order sub process.
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
Responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:
<BR>§	Issuing correct and complete work orders
<BR>§	Decomposing a work order into elementary work items
<BR>§	Managing task assignments
<BR>§	Tracking and managing dispatching
<BR>§	Manually executing an order by an assignee
<BR>§	Monitoring the execution of assigned activities, including the various states of dispatch, complete, suspend, cancel, etc. as well as requesting work reassignments
<BR>§	Establishing and managing fast-track and jeopardy re-assignment capabilities to allow for modification of work assignments as required to meet jeopardy or other high priority conditions
<BR>§	Closing a work order when the manual activities assigned to employees and/or third parties have been completed
<BR>§	Supporting proactive and dynamic responses by executing and analyzing operational reports
