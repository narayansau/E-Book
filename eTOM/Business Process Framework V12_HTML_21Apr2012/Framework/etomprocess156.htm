<H2>(2) eTOM Process Type S/P Requisition Management</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.4.2</H3>
<H3>Category: (2) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Track, monitor and report on the service provider initiated product and/or service provisioning engagements to ensure that the interactions are in accordance with the agreed commercial arrangements between the service provider and the Supplier/Partner.
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The S/P Requisition Management processes track, monitor and report on the service provider initiated product, service and/or resource provisioning engagements to ensure that the interactions are in accordance with the agreed commercial arrangements between the service provider and the Supplier/Partner. 
<BR>External suppliers/partners are engaged by the service provider in provisioning activities when:
<BR><ul><LI>specific resources need to be purchased and delivered to satisfy resource orders;
<BR><LI>the service provider has outsourced specific activities to suppliers/partners that are required to be utilized as part of provisioning activity (i.e. outsourced installation activities);
<BR><LI>the specific service is purchased from an external supplier (as in an interconnect service);
<BR><LI>the specific product and/or service, or specific product and/or service component, is owned and delivered by an external partner, or
<BR><LI>previously issued requisitions for specific resources or services need to be modified or cancelled.
</ul>
<BR>
<BR>In all of the above cases, the actual engagement in the provisioning processes is initiated by the specific Track &amp; Manage process of either the RM&amp;O or SM&amp;O process layer.
<BR>Where S/P Requisition Management processes are engaged to manage requisitions of specific resources or outsourced product and/or services from partners/suppliers, these processes are responsible to ensure on-time and correct delivery of the specific resource or outsourced product and/or service. If several suppliers are available, these processes are responsible for selecting between the alternative suppliers with whom a relationship exists. A specification for the S/P supplied resource or product and/or service component is received from the RM&amp;O, SM&amp;O or CRM processes and the range of contracted suppliers surveyed to select the most cost-effective (cost / time trade-off) or to meet pre-agreed volume commitment targets.
<BR>Where the engagement with an external supplier/partner is for purchased or delivered specific products, services and/or resources, as the case may be, these processes create and close S/P requisition orders, undertake tracking and management of the supplier/partner provisioning activity, and provide reporting.
