<H3>Remarks</H3>
The TM Forum does not at this stage intend to completely develop Level 3 and further process decompositions and flows for all Enterprise Management Level 2 processes. The Enterprise Management processes tend to be generic in the sense that they are applicable to all enterprises and cross-industry models may become available which can be used. However, in some cases the eTOM working team is able to provide Level 3 decompositions based on the knowledge contained within information and communications service providers organizations.
