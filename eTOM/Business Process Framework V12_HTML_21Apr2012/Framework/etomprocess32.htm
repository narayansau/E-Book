<H2>(1) eTOM Process Type Infrastructure Lifecycle Management</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: Not Applicable</H3>
<H3>Category: (1) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Infrastructure Lifecycle Management: this vertical end-end process grouping is responsible for the definition, planning and implementation of all necessary infrastructures (application, computing and network), as well as all other support infrastructures and business capabilities (operations centers, architectures, etc.). This applies in connection with the resource layer or any other functional layer, e.g., CRM Voice Response Units, required to provide Information and Communications products to the Customer and to support the business. These vertical end-end processes identify new requirements, new capabilities and design and develop new or enhanced infrastructure to support products. Infrastructure Lifecycle Management vertical end-end processes respond to needs of the Product Lifecycle Management vertical end-end processes whether unit cost reductions, product quality improvements, new products, etc.
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
Lifecycle Management vertical end-end process groupings drive and enable core operations and customer processes to meet market demand and customer expectations. Performance of Lifecycle processes are viewed at the highest levels of the enterprise, due to their impact on customer retention and competitiveness. There are two end-to-end Lifecycle Management processes introduced in the eTOM framework, i.e., Infrastructure and Product.  Both end-end processes have a development and deployment nature, in terms of introducing new infrastructure, or a new product. Infrastructure Lifecycle Management deals with development and deployment of new infrastructure, assessing performance of the infrastructure and taking action to meet performance commitments. Product Lifecycle Management deals with introducing new products, in the form of services delivered to Customers, and assessing and taking action on product performance.
<BR>The eTOM framework consciously decouples the Lifecycle Management processes from day-to-day operations processes represented by the Operations Processes (Operations Support &amp; Readiness, Fulfillment, Assurance &amp; Billing). In the past, some of these processes were not distinguished from the core operations framework and this sometimes resulted in some confusion and lack of guidance for designing processes. Lifecycle Management vertical end-end processes have different business cycle times, different types of objectives for the enterprise and are inherently different processes than operations processes, i.e., enabling processes rather than operations processes. Mixing these processes with the customer operational processes diminishes focus on the Lifecycle Management vertical end-end processes. In addition, Lifecycle Management processes need to be designed to meet cycle time and other performance characteristics critical to the success of the enterprise, e.g., new product time to market, and infrastructure unit cost. The Lifecycle Management end-end processes interact with each other. The Product Lifecycle Management vertical end-end process drives the majority of the direction for the Infrastructure Lifecycle Management vertical end-end processes either directly or indirectly, for example. However Infrastructure Lifecycle Management vertical end-end processes are also driven by decisions within the Strategy &amp; Commit vertical end-end processes to deploy new infrastructure in support of new business directions.  These processes prepare the customer and functional operations processes to support customer interaction for products, providing the infrastructure for the products to use and providing the supplier and partner interface structure for the enterprise offers. To enable and support customer and functional operations, these processes often have to synchronize for on-time and quality delivery.
