<H2>(3) eTOM Process Type Manage Supply Chain Contract Variation</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.2.4.3.2</H3>
<H3>Category: (3) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Manage changes to the commercial terms of a contract during its term of agreement
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The Manage Supply Chain Contract Variation processes manage changes to the commercial terms of a contract during its term of agreement. Variations can occur to the commercial terms themselves (i.e. prices), or to the technical, functional and operational specifications on which the contract was agreed. In addition, changes can occur to the list of items (modification, expansion or reduction) within the contract upon which the SPRM operational processes can place orders. These processes manage all activities which result in a joint commercial agreement to vary the terms of the original negotiated agreement. 
<BR>In addition, these processes also manage any agreements between the enterprise and the supplier/partner of “within agreement” product volumes, their specification, pricing and delivery timetable.
