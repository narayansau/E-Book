<H2>(4) eTOM Process Type Assign Task</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.3.7.9.3</H3>
<H3>Category: (4) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
The Assign Task process is responsible for assigning manual activities, described by work items (components of work orders), to assignable staff within the enterprise and/or third parties.
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The association of a work item with a technician who is assigned to this work is a task, or, task assignment is a work item assignment to a particular performer.
<BR>
<BR>The scope of the Assign Task process includes the following:
<BR>§	Establishing and managing work assignment queues through which requests for task assignments are received from other eTOM processes
<BR>§	Automatic, manual, or semi-automatic assigning and scheduling based on optimization of the task, taking into consideration various parameters including the following:
<BR>§	Work order priority
<BR>§	Associated SLAs
<BR>§	Work order due date
<BR>§	Skills required to perform work
<BR>§	Dependencies between work tasks
<BR>§	Job location relative to other assignments made to the dispatchable staff
<BR>§	Workload of staff
<BR>§	Staff availability hours
<BR>§	Required materials, spares, and tools availability
<BR>§	Maintaining bulk assignment capabilities
<BR>§	Managing relocation of other previously scheduled tasks which have floating work schedules, aiming at increasing manpower availability
<BR>§	Optimizing the assignment of tasks to technicians selected according to skills, proximity to intervention site, technician availability, vehicles, equipment, and special tools required to perform these activities
<BR>§	Interacting with GIS for route optimization between task locations
<BR>§	Defining “density distribution” patterns for bulk automated assignments of technicians for the entire day to provide the capability to “insert” new assignments throughout a work day based on priority work that might arise
<BR>§	Viewing the availability schedule of assignable staff from various workforce sources
<BR>§	Preparing information to be dispatched as updates to already-dispatched tasks
