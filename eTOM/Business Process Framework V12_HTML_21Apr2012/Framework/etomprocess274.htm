<H2>(3) eTOM Process Type Issue Service Orders</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.2.2.7</H3>
<H3>Category: (3) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Issue correct and complete service orders
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The purpose of the Issue Service Orders processes is to issue correct and complete service orders.
<BR>The service orders may be required to satisfy pertinent customer order information received, may arise as a result of requests for service provisioning to satisfy service problem recovery activities, may arise to alleviate service performance issues, or may arise as a result of information received from suppliers/partners in relations to specific services.
<BR>These processes assess the information contained in the customer order, through a service order request, relating to the purchased product offering, initiating service process or supplier/partner initiated request, to determine the associated service orders that need to be issued.
<BR>The issued service order may require a service feasibility assessment or a service design to be produced, may require new provisioning activities for specific services, may require a change to a previously issued service order, or may require deletion and/or recovery of previously delivered specific services. Where, the initiating request or the purchased product offering has a standard set of associated service orders this process is responsible for issuing the service orders, and for creating a record of the relevant initiating request or customer order information and the associated service orders.
<BR>Where the initiating request or the purchased product offering has special or unusual requirements, and a specific feasibility assessment and/or service design has been previously created, this process is responsible for issuing the service orders, and for creating a record of the relevant initiating request or customer order information and the associated service orders.
<BR>Where the purchased product offering has special or unusual requirements, and a specific feasibility assessment and/or specific service design has not been previously created, this process marks the issued service order as requiring special handling, and passes management for further processing to the Track &amp; Manage Service Provisioning process.
<BR>The orchestration, if required, and tracking of the service order progress is the responsibility of the Track &amp; Manage Service Provisioning processes.
