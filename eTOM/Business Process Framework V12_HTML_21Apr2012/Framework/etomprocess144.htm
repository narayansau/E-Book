<H2>(2) eTOM Process Type Business Continuity Management</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.3.2.1</H3>
<H3>Category: (2) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Manage the development of strategies, policies, plans, organizational roles &amp; responsibilities, and escalation procedures for ensuring continuation of business processes and activities in the event of serious and/or sustained interruption
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
Business Continuity Management processes manage the development of strategies, policies, plans, organizational roles &amp; responsibilities, and escalation procedures for ensuring continuation of business processes and activities in the event of serious and/or sustained interruption. These processes ensure that appropriate plans and procedures are established and tested to provide continuous operation, or controlled re-establishment, of key business processes and activities, to provide for a controlled recovery of infrastructure capability to normal levels, and for determination of operational accountability and processes until the abnormal circumstances are resolved. These processes have four major aspects:
<BR> Business continuity planning which provides for the proactive planning and testing of business and operational procedure continuity;
<BR> Infrastructure recovery planning which provides for the pro-active determination of recovery and backup procedures for all key infrastructure capabilities, and their proactive testing;
<BR> Serious incident management planning which defines the operational roles and responsibilities, and proactively defines the operational procedures and escalation criteria which are initiated when abnormal operation circumstances occur; and
<BR> Business continuity management methodologies, which ensure consistent application of business continuity management across the enterprise.
<BR>Note that business continuity management is an extended process structure which incorporates disaster recovery planning.
<BR>Note that serious incident management is used instead of crisis management as serious disruption can occur to the business through events which would not normally be classified as a crisis.
