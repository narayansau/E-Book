The purpose of the Support S/P Requisition Management processes is twofold - to manage requisition activity with suppliers/partners who own and manage outsourced infrastructure, and to ensure that the S/P Requisition Management processes can operate effectively.
<BR>External suppliers/partners are engaged by the service provider in infrastructure level provisioning-related activities when the service provider has outsourced the relevant infrastructure ownership and management to suppliers/partners (i.e. outsourced network or IT bureau arrangements).
<BR>The actual engagement with the supplier/partner is initiated by the specific fulfillment or provisioning enablement processes of the CRM, RM&amp;O or SM&amp;O process layers.
<BR>Where Enable S/P Requisition Management processes are engaged to manage new and/or modified infrastructure deployment and/or capacity availability, these processes are responsible to ensure on-time and correct deployment and delivery of the requested infrastructure.
<BR>For the S/P Requisition Management processes the role of the Support S/P Requisition Management processes is to make sure that there is sufficient process capacity and capability (for example, information, materials, systems and resources) so that the S/P Requisition Management processes can operate effectively. Examples are: information on how to process requisitions for specific S/P products, materials needed to confirm requisition requests, systems needed to validate supplier/partner product and service availability.
<BR>The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:
<BR><ul><LI>arranging and managing supplier/partner access to appropriate service provider infrastructure deployment support tools (including any appropriate Inventories) and processes;
<BR><LI>arranging and managing service provider access to appropriate supplier/partner infrastructure deployment support tools (including any appropriate Inventories) and processes;
