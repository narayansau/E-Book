<H2>(2) eTOM Process Type ITIL Service Catalogue Management</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.3.3.8</H3>
<H3>Category: (2) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Service Catalog Management is defined within ITIL. Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Service Catalog Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.

These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>From the eTOM perspective, ITIL Service – compared with SID Resource Facing Service and Customer Facing Service, ITIL Service is defined as services serving one business unit, multiple business units or business external to the enterprise; by convention we should identify the first two as RFS and the latter as CFS.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Linkage with eTOM process areas</FONT></B></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>ITIL Service Catalog Management relates to several eTOM process areas.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The eTOM processes affected include: Within Operations: </FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Identifier: 1.1.1.1</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Element: CRM Support &amp; Readiness</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Impact:</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Where ITIL Service Catalog Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the CRM Support &amp; Readiness processes operate in line with this.
