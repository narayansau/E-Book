<H2>(2) eTOM Process Type S/P Problem Reporting &amp; Management</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.4.3</H3>
<H3>Category: (2) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Track, monitor and report on the service provider initiated problem engagements to ensure that the interactions are in accordance with the agreed commercial arrangements between the service provider and the Supplier/Partner.
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The S/P Problem Reporting &amp; Management processes track, monitor and report on the service provider initiated problem engagements to ensure that the interactions are in accordance with the agreed commercial arrangements between the service provider and the Supplier/Partner. 
<BR>In addition, external suppliers/partners may report S/P discovered problems to the service provider which may impact resources, services and/or customers. 
<BR>External suppliers/partners are engaged by the service provider in correction and recovery activities when:
<BR><ul><LI>higher level expertise and/or higher level support is required to resolve the service problem or resource trouble, (which may be automatic in the case of highest priority service problems or resource troubles);
<BR><LI>the service provider has outsourced specific activities to a supplier/partner which are needed as part of problem management resolution (i.e. outsourced field maintenance);
<BR><LI>the specific service has been purchased from an external supplier (as in an interconnect service); or
<BR><LI>the specific product and/or service, or specific product and/or service component, is owned and maintained by an external partner.
</ul>
<BR>
<BR>In all of the above cases, the actual engagement in the correction and recovery processes is initiated by the specific Track &amp; Manage process of the RM&amp;O, SM&amp;O or CRM process layer.
<BR>
<BR>Where the engagement with an external supplier/partner is for purchased or delivered product, services and/or resources, as the case may be, these processes create and close S/P problem reports, undertake tracking and management of the supplier/partner problem resolution activity, and provide reporting.
