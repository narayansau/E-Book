<P><IMG SRC="diagram200.png" USEMAP="#COORDdiagrame6de58e3d8dd11db943e000e3573f0d3htm" ALT=" Infrastructure Lifecycle Management" LONGDESC="The Infrastructure Lifecycle Management process grouping is responsible for the definition, planning and implementation of all necessary infrastructures (application, computing and network), as well as all other support infrastructures and business capabilities (operations centers, architectures, etc.). This applies in connection with the resource layer or any other functional layer, e.g., CRM Voice Response Units, required to provide Information and Communications products to the Customer and to support the business. These processes identify new requirements, new capabilities and design and develop new or enhanced infrastructure to support products.

Infrastructure Lifecycle Management processes respond to needs of the Product Lifecycle Management processes whether unit cost reductions, product quality improvements, new products, etc.Lifecycle Management processes drive and enable core operations and customer processes to meet market demand and customer expectations. Performance of Lifecycle processes are viewed at the highest levels of the enterprise, due to their impact on customer retention and competitiveness. There are two end-to-end Lifecycle Management processes introduced in the eTOM, i.e., Infrastructure and Product.  Both processes have a development and deployment nature, in terms of introducing new infrastructure, or a new product. Infrastructure Lifecycle Management deals with development and deployment of new infrastructure, assessing performance of the infrastructure and taking action to meet performance commitments. 

Product Lifecycle Management deals with introducing new products, in the form of services delivered to Customers, and assessing and taking action on product performance.The eTOM consciously decouples the Lifecycle Management processes from day-to-day operations processes represented by the Operations Processes (Operations Support &amp; Readiness, Fulfillment, Assurance &amp; Billing). In the past, the TOM integrated some of these processes in the core operations framework and this sometimes resulted in some confusion and lack of understanding.  

Lifecycle Management processes have different business cycle times, different types of objectives for the enterprise and are inherently different processes than operations processes, i.e., business processes not operations processes. Mixing these processes with the customer priority processes diminishes focus on the Lifecycle Management processes, enabling and supporting customer operations processes.  Processes in an ebusiness environment must all look to how they are enabling and supporting interaction with the customer.  In addition, Lifecycle Management processes need to be designed to meet cycle time and other performance characteristics critical to the success of the enterprise, e.g., new product time to market, and infrastructure unit cost. Another key characteristic of the Lifecycle Management processes is that they interact with almost every other process of the enterprise.  The Lifecycle Management processes also interact with each other.  

The Product Lifecycle Management process drives the majority of the direction for the Infrastructure Lifecycle Management processes either directly or indirectly, for example. These processes prepare the customer and functional operations processes to support customer interaction for products, providing the infrastructure for the products to ride and providing the supplier and partner interface structure for the enterprise offers. To enable and support customer and functional operations, these processes often have to synchronize for on-time and quality delivery.

Purpose/Description:Overall LifecycleLifecycle Management processes operate on different business cycles than operational, direct customer supporting processes.  They are fundamentally different than customer instance processes as follows:·Longer cycle time·Planning, forecasting and commitment oriented·Development Project Oriented·Cross-organizational·Corporate Commitment FocusedWhether responsible for product, infrastructure or supply chain lifecycle management processes, the processes are accountable to the enterprise for performance to the firm for the total lifecycle, including the planning, forecasting, commitment, development and retirement of its elements, reporting performance and taking action.  The lifecycle management processes provide direction and support to the customer instance processes.  These processes also drive changes in the operations processes, whether viewed as the functional or direct customer processes.  Lifecycle Management processes, particularly the Product Lifecycle processes, take significant input from the customer operations processes.Lifecycle Management processes are called lifecycle because these processes manage the life, from creation to retirement, of either a product, a supplier or an infrastructure element.  The management of the ongoing lifecycle of a product, a supplier or an infrastructure element is, and was in the TOM, represented by the processes that are planning, forecasting and commitment oriented.  Whereas, the development and retirement processes of each lifecycle process grouping are basically project oriented. Both the ongoing lifecycle processes and the development/retirement processes are cross-organizational and corporate commitment in nature.  A key difference of the eTOM and the TOM is the segregation of lifecycle management from day-to-day operations activities.  This means that Service Planning and Development, Resource Planning and Development were removed from the operations core processes that support Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing.  This does not mean that these processes don't exist, but rather that they directly support the lifecycle management processes.  However, day-to-day operations processes may trigger process activity in the lifecycle processes, but this should not be a regular occurrence.  The Planning and Development processes in each of the functional areas will appear in the decompositions of Lifecycle Management processes.  With the addition of Supplier/Partner Relationship Management (S/PRM), S/PRM Planning and Development processes are new in the eTOM.  These processes directly correlate to the kinds of processes that the other Planning and Development processes involve, e.g., service component forecasting for Service Planning or physical element forecasting for Resource Planning, but for S/PRM Planning and Development, the forecasting would be directed at suppliers and supplier provided elements.  In TOM, Customer Relationship Management Planning and Development processes were not acknowledged.  CRM Planning and Development is as important as the other Planning and Development processes in providing infrastructure development, e.g., designing, developing and deploying VRU (Voice Response Unit) capability, and product development, e.g., designing, developing and deploying different levels of customer service support to provide different service products of platinum, gold and silver.Lifecycle Management processes are end-to-end oriented processes, as are Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing processes. The customer operations processes of Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing are functional by nature.   

It is important to note that each of the lifecycle processes are not functionally driven processes, as are the operations processes.  The processes are inherently different.  The functional processes of the enterprise collaborate to deliver a new infrastructure, a new product or a new element of a supply chain.  Cycle time for Fulfillment processes can be looked at functionally.  Cycle times for Lifecycle processes can only be looked at functionally as they relate to the end-to-end processes they support, e.g., Product Development-Concept Development.  However, this does not mean that there are not functional components of each of the Lifecycle Management processes.  The customer operations and functional process components that support the lifecycle management processes appear at a lower level of process decomposition.  This is not visible in the eTOM yet, since eTOM has not developed process decomposition for the Lifecycle Management processes below Level 2.  As the eTOM develops, it will be apparent that the Lifecycle Management processes drive change in the core operations processes and what functional processes support the Lifecycle Management processes.  In the appendix that shows some of the other concepts being worked for the eTOM, the functional participation in the lifecycle processes is discussed.  The highest level of the eTOM looks at all processes as they are m+D17easured and impact the enterprise.  This is how the executive management of the firm would view the processes and their results.  However, as the Appendix points out, a totally functional view is appropriate for many purposes.  Taking a totally functional view, would provide a six by six matrix with the three lifecycle and three customer operations process groupings shown in the vertical columns and the four operations process groupings and two enabling and support functional process groupings shown as the horizontal rows.  In subsequent releases of the eTOM, both views will be shown, since they are both useful.An area that may cause confusion for some is that the eTOM includes both Product and Offer Management and Development, as well as Product Lifecycle Management.  

The Product and Offer Management and Development processes are the functional processes in Marketing related process grouping.  These processes are the functional processes that support the Product Lifecycle Management processes just like there are functional processes in CRM, SM&amp;O, RM&amp;O and S/PRM that have process elements within the Lifecycle Management processes.  The Product and Offer Management and Development have functional processes that can be decomposed to support each element of the Lifecycle Management processes, e.g., forecasting of revenues and units is a key sub-process of the Product Lifecycle Management, Product Planning and Commitment Level 2 process.Infrastructure Life cycle Management:Infrastructure Lifecycle Management processes develop the resource infrastructure to support the offer of products and services to the customer.  It generally works on a longer timeline than the Product and Offer Lifecycle Management processes.  These processes identify new requirements, new capabilities and design and develop new or enhanced infrastructure to support products and services.  A new technology may be available in the market that could lower infrastructure unit cost.  These processes would assess the potential impact on infrastructure unit costs, determine viability for the enterprise's infrastructure and implement in the infrastructure.  Infrastructure Lifecycle Management processes respond to needs of the Product and Lifecycle Management processes whether unit cost reductions, service quality improvements, new products or services, etc.  These processes may also have to respond or collaborate with Supply Chain Lifecycle Management processes to deliver a new product or service and/or a new component of infrastructure.Infrastructure Lifecycle Management processes provide the base for fast new product and service delivery to the market.   The efficient and effective management of the infrastructure resources significantly contribute to the quality of products and services offered, the unit cost the enterprise can base its pricing on.  Infrastructure is usually thought of as the network, application and computing resources.  Infrastructure is also the process and resource infrastructure for each functional layer of operations processes.  For example, CRM functional processes depend upon significant infrastructure to deliver customer support for products and services, e.g., Voice Response Units, Websites, electronic bonding with customers, etc.  Infrastructure Lifecycle Management processes have different triggers and a different view than the Product Lifecycle Management processes.  

The Product Lifecycle Management processes are triggered and view the market and how that impacts products and services.  Infrastructure Lifecycle Management processes are triggered by and view the resource technologies, the advent of new technologies, performance of the infrastructure resources to support the enterprise.eTOM, different from the TOM, integrates resource infrastructure lifecycle management across application, computing and network resources, as well as across operations functions.  These processes also include the lifecycle management of information technology.  This is different than the TOM, where there was a separate process grouping for Information Systems processes.  It is important to note that Information Systems Strategy and Decision making for the enterprise is part of the Enterprise Management process grouping.  This is because it is critical that the Information Systems strategies are developed through the Enterprise Management strategies.  These strategies and policies, as well as priorities, drive the information technologies strategies and policies, including the selection of technologies.  Information Systems Management is more about overall systems and ebusiness strategy.  Whereas, Information Technology management is about the realization of these strategies."></P>
