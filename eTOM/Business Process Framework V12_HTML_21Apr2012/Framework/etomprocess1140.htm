<H2>(4) eTOM Process Type Terminate Customer Relatoinship</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.1.9.1.3</H3>
<H3>Category: (4) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Terminates customer relationship. Significant customer life-stage events or business decisions by the Service Provider cause one or both parties to terminate the relationship. The customer relationship is terminated only if actually appropriate, the wishes of the customer are complied with where possible, records are kept in case the relationship with the customer is re-established, legal and ethical requirements for customer information are complied with. The need for complete termination of relationships needs to be differentiated from just terminating all services. The principles behind this include the Service Provider ending a relationship only if the customer ceases to exist, or the customer is fraudulent, the Enterprise decides that it no longer wishes to do business with the customer.
