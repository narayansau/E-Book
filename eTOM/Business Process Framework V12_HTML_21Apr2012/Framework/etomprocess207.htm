<H2>(3) eTOM Process Type Design Solution</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.2.2.1</H3>
<H3>Category: (3) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Develop an end-end specific service design which complies with a particular customer's requirement
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The purpose of the Design Solution processes is to develop an end-end specific service design which complies with a particular customer's requirement. 
<BR>These processes are invoked when a customer order requires special or unusual end-end service arrangements, which are not able to be satisfied using standard service arrangements.  These processes may be invoked as part of a service feasibility assessment, or as a result of a confirmed customer order.
<BR>The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:
<BR>·
<TAB>Developing an overall service solution design for a particular customer, including customer premises equipment, operational methods, resource assignments and pre-order feasibility;
<BR>·
<TAB>Developing an implementation plan considering training and operational support measures and needs, such as the proper parameter information for the Service Quality Management process;
<BR>·
<TAB>Consideration of current and future service and underlying resources infrastructure, as well as expected solution results, budget, duration and risks;
<BR>·
<TAB>Consideration of the time schedule according with customer requirements;
<BR>·
<TAB>Ensure service and provisioning efficiency;
<BR>·
<TAB>Undertaking a business assessment, ensuring an appropriate time-to-revenue as a result of the service and underlying resource investment; and·
<TAB>Developing a detailed design identifying the relevant service orders to be issued to the Implement,
<BR> Configure &amp; Activate Service process and the Allocate Specific Service Parameters to Services processes.
<BR>A specific service design may require inclusion of some or all of the above aspects depending on whether the service design is being undertaken as part of a feasibility assessment, or is being developed as a result of a committed customer order.
<BR>These processes invoke requests to RM&amp;O provisioning processes to determine the availability of suitable specific resources, or to suppliers /partners though the S/PRM process in the event that the service design requires either the inclusion of outsourced or partner provided specific services.
