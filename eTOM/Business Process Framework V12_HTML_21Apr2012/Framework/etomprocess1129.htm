<H2>(4) eTOM Process Type Determine Required Customer Data</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.1.4.4.1</H3>
<H3>Category: (4) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
In most standard offerings the necessary customer data is often captured on the sales proposal agreement form associated with the standard offerings.  For non-standard and/or complex sales agreements associated, for instance, with a customer RFP, extensive customer information may be required to plan and roll-out the agreed solution.  For example, Centrex designs require extensive capture of details surrounding deployment of handsets, features associated with each handset, customer Centrex groups, etc.  In some cases the necessary level of precise detail may be available from the Develop Sales Proposal.  Where this is not the case, this process is responsible for determining the precise customer information required to support the agreed proposal.
