<H2>(4) eTOM Process Type Correlate Service Performance Event Notifications</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.2.4.1.3</H3>
<H3>Category: (4) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
This process passes information about specific service failures due to performance quality threshold violations to Service Problem Management to manage any necessary restoration activity as determined by that process.  It passes information about potential specific customer SLA/QoS performance degradations arising from specific service quality performance degradations (using knowledge about service to purchased 
<BR>product offering linkages) to Problem Handling to manage any necessary restoration activity as determined by that process.  It forwards service performance degradation notifications to other Service Quality Management processes, which manage activities to restore normal specific service performance quality.
<BR>
<BR>Perform automated service testing using simulated calls simulating standard user behavior, collect data related to service usage
