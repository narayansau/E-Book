<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.4.1.3</H3>

<H3>Brief Description</H3>

<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The purpose of the Support S/P Performance Management processes is twofold - to manage performance restoration activity with suppliers/partners who own and manage outsourced infrastructure, and to ensure that the S/P Performance Management processes can operate effectively.
<BR>External suppliers/partners are engaged by the service provider in infrastructure level performance-related activities when the service provider has outsourced the relevant infrastructure ownership and management to suppliers/partners (i.e. outsourced network or IT bureau arrangements).
<BR>The actual engagement with the supplier/partner is initiated by the specific performance support processes of the CRM, RM&amp;O or SM&amp;O process layers. Where Support S/P Performance Management processes are engaged to resolve infrastructure level performance issues, these processes are responsible to ensure on-time and correct resolution and re-establishment of normal infrastructure operation.
<BR>
<BR>For the S/P Performance Management processes the role of the Support S/P Performance Management processes is to ensure that there is capability (for example, information, materials, systems and resources) so that the S/P Performance Management processes can operate effectively. 
<BR>
<BR>The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:
<BR>
<BR><ul><LI>Arranging and managing supplier/partner access to appropriate service provider performance management support tools (including any appropriate Inventories) and processes;
