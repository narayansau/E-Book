<H2>(2) eTOM Process Type ITIL Change Management</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.3.1.6</H3>
<H3>Category: (2) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Change Management is defined within ITIL. Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Change Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.
