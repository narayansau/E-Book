<H2>(2) eTOM Process Type Supply Chain Development &amp; Change Management</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.2.4.3</H3>
<H3>Category: (2) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Support the development of a supply chain, to support S/P product catalogue extension or modification.
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
Supply Chain Development &amp; Change Management processes support  the development of a supply chain, to support service catalogue extension or modification. New suppliers may be required to broaden the services a service provider offers its customers, to improve performance, for outsourcing and out-tasking requirements, etc. These project-oriented processes identify new suppliers or partners, develop agreements and implement with the supplier or partner. In addition, these processes drive automation and change management for the supply chain. e.g. new/modified processes and IT applications may be needed so that Mobile Number Portability can be for Third-generation Mobiles can be offered. Supply Chain Development &amp; Change Management processes manage the on-going commercial arrangements and processes between the enterprise and the selected supplier/partner, and manage the periodic agreement on specifications for deliverables within the context of the negotiated commercial agreement. 
<BR>These processes recognize that the initial commercial arrangements may need to be varied over the course of the commercial agreement and manage the processes which deliver this commercial variation.  These processes also manage regular agreement between the enterprise and the supplier/partner on product deliverables, their specification, pricing and delivery timetable.
<BR>In addition the end-end commercial, delivery and operational processes between the enterprise and supplier/partner need to be monitored, reviewed and changed to improve their effectiveness. 
<BR>These processes particularly apply when the commercial arrangements between the two parties exist over an extended period, and the commercial agreement allows for the on-going specification of deliverables within the period of the commercial agreement.  Shorter-term commercial agreements are unlikely to require the comprehensive level of commercial administration that these processes bring (but note that S/P Support &amp; Readiness processes may have a role in this case).
