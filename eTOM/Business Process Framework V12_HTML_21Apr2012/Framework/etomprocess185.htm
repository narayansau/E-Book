<H2>(3) eTOM Process Type Qualify Opportunity</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.1.4.2</H3>
<H3>Category: (3) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Ensure that the opportunity is qualified in terms of any associated risk and the amount of effort required to achieve a sale
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The purpose of the Qualify Opportunity process is to ensure that the opportunity is qualified in terms of any associated risk, and the amount of effort required (e.g. response to a Request for Proposal 
[RFP]) to achieve a sale. The opportunity is explored with the customer to ensure the offer meets the customer’s expectations, and to ensure that the breadth of the customer requirement is understood.  Extended interactions with the customer may be required to achieve mutual understanding and agreement.  The opportunity may require the development of alternative solutions or customization to the specific customer’s requirements. The Qualify Opportunity process is responsible for assessing the size of the potential development and its risk.  The resources, financing and potential on-going customer commitment to the developed solution are all factors that must be assessed.  These processes also need to assess the strategic importance of the opportunity, the potential for wider application, and the importance of the specific customer to the enterprise. The solution alternatives must be available (e.g. capacity) or scheduled on a product roadmap
