ebusiness involves increasingly complex networks of relationships to operate. The figure depicts the sets of relationship groupings involved in a value network in the ICT industry. The value network must operate with the efficiency of a self-contained enterprise, which requires managing the network on a process rather than an organizational basis. The model explicitly shows the use of the eTOM Business Process Framework by the Service Provider at its core. It is only shown here to simplify the figure and its presence is not intended to imply that its use by the Service Provider is prescribed, just that the Service Provider would probably benefit from its use. Likewise, it is not intended to  preclude the use of eTOM by the other entities shown within the value network. These entities may or may not make use of the eTOM Business Process Framework.
