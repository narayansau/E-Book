<H3>Category: (4) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>

If the customer QoS performance degradation report is created as a result of a notification from customers or as a result of a request from other processes, the Create Customer QoS Performance Degradation Report processes are responsible for converting the received information into a form suitable for the Customer QoS/SLA Management processes, and for requesting additional information if required.
