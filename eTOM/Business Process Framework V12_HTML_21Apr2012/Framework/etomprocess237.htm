<H2>(2) eTOM Process Type Enterprise Architecture Management</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.3.1.3</H3>
<H3>Category: (2) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Define, develop, manage and maintain the enterprise architecture.
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
Enterprise Architecture Management processes define, develop, manage and maintain the enterprise architecture, which is the model describing the enterprise in all its facets. These processes define/select, develop and deploy the enterprise architecture methodology, which is a framework that identifies the reference models, their relationships to each other, and the architecture management processes used to establish and maintain the enterprise architecture. The framework contains the policies, guidelines, documentation templates and approaches to be used throughout the enterprise. In addition Enterprise Architecture Management details the processes used to capture, modify, communicate, and review the enterprise architecture and manage exceptions to it. These processes define and select the toolsets used to capture the enterprise architecture (e.g. UML tools), and develop any required standards or reference framework to be used with the tools. The processes define, develop and maintain the repositories and associated repository meta-models to be used to capture architecture details, and manage and administer the capture processes. 
<BR>In addition enterprise architecture management processes define the skill sets require for architects, develop training programs and manage any certification process for architects across the enterprise.
<BR>Enterprise Architecture Management provides the reference source for the enterprise Standard Operating Environment that is the collection of applications, hardware, software and network components that have been standardized for use across the enterprise.
<BR>Lastly, enterprise architecture management provides a point of review for strategy and tactical/solution architecture, and defines and manages the review processes.
<BR>The business strategies and plans provide a key starting point for the development and direction provide by the Enterprise Architecture Management.
<BR>Note that enterprise architecture management covers both IT and network technologies.
<BR>The Enterprise Architecture Management processes impact other areas within the eTOM model, such as Knowledge Management and Process Architecture Management.
