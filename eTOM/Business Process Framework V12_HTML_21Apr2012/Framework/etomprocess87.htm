<H2>(3) eTOM Process Type Monitor Resource Performance</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.3.4.1</H3>
<H3>Category: (3) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Monitor received resource performance information and undertake first-in detection.
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The objective of the Monitor Resource Performance processes is to monitor received resource performance information and undertake first-in detection.
<BR>The responsibilities of the processes include, but are not limited to:
<BR>·
<TAB>Undertaking the role of first in detection by monitoring the received specific resource performance data;
<BR>·
<TAB>Comparing the received specific resource performance data to performance standards set for each specific resource (available from the Resource Inventory);
<BR>·
<TAB>Assessing and recording received specific resource performance data which is within tolerance limits for performance standards, and for which continuous monitoring and measuring of specific resource performance is required;
<BR>·
<TAB>Recording the results of the continuous monitoring for reporting through the Report Resource Performance processes;
<BR>·
<TAB>Detecting performance threshold violations which represent specific resource failures due to abnormal performance;
<BR>·
<TAB>Passing information about resource failures due to performance threshold violations to Resource Trouble Management to manage any necessary restoration activity as determined by that process;
<BR>·
<TAB>Passing information about potential specific service performance degradations arising from specific resource degradations to Service Quality Management to manage any necessary restoration activity as determined by that process;
<BR>·
<TAB>Detecting performance degradation for specific resources which provide early warning of potential issues;
<BR>·
<TAB>Forwarding resource performance degradation notifications to other Resource Performance Management processes, which manage activities to restore normal specific resource performance; and
<BR>·
<TAB>Logging specific resource performance degradation and violation details within the repository in the Manage Resource Inventory processes to ensure historical records are available to support the needs of other processes.
