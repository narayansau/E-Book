<H2>(3) eTOM Process Type Develop New Product Business Proposal</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.2.1.5.3</H3>
<H3>Category: (3) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Develop and document business proposals for the identified new product concept
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The Develop New Product Business Proposal processes develop and document business proposals for the identified new product concept (including if necessary a business case). The business proposal (or business case) identifies the new product requirements, including the specific service components which constitute the product. The business proposal also identifies the development costs and anticipated benefits, including forecast demand, revenue gains, productivity gains, performance improvements and/or operational cost improvements. In addition, these processes define the attributes of the product which form the basis for product advertising and sales. The business proposal also includes an assessment of the risks and the competitive positioning of the product proposal. As a part of the business proposal development a feasibility assessment can be produced. Potential suppliers/partners who can assist in the development of the product are also identified. As a part of the process, the business proposal is appropriately approved, and as a result of the approval, necessary resources are made available.
