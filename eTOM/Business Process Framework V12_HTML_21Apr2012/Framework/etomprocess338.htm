<BR><LI>Establishing and managing S/P requisition processes for obtaining S/P products and/or services;
<BR><LI>Establishing and managing S/P problem and performance resolution processes for S/P products and/or services;

<BR><LI>Arranging and administering Supplier/Partner access to Service Provider support tools and facilities, and vice versa;
<BR><LI>Monitoring and reporting on requests made to Suppliers/Partners where the Supplier/Partner owns and manages the particular infrastructure,
