<H2>(2) eTOM Process Type ITIL Incident Management</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.3.3.9</H3>
<H3>Category: (2) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Incident Management is defined within ITIL. Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Incident Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.

These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>From the eTOM perspective, each incident is qualified according to its layer of origin. So, for example, an incident created in the customer layer may be described as a Customer Incident, etc. (Similarly, this qualification by layer is applied to the identification of the underlying problem. For example, a Problem identified in the Service Management layer may be initially described as an Service Problem. However, it may be subsequently described as a Resource Problem following root cause determination.)From the ITIL perspective, a single end-to-end activity is envisaged that does not necessitate the creation of complementary objects in other layers as occurs in eTOM. Now, turning to the terms used by each approach.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>In the ITIL approach, it is necessary to distinguish 3 terms. ITIL Incident, ITIL Problem and ITIL Service Request.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>ITIL Incident. An unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service. The failure of a configuration item that has not yet impacted service is also an ITIL incident, for example the failure of one disk from a mirror set.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>ITIL Problem. An ITIL Problem is the underlying cause of one or more ITIL incidents and remains a separate entity. An ITIL Problem must be solved to prevent the ITIL incident from recurring. ITIL Incident Management forms part of the overall process of dealing with problems in the organization and provides a point where these are reported.</FONT></FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>ITIL Service Request. Used as a generic description for many varying types of demands that are placed upon the IT Department by the users. Many of these are actually small changes<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>.. low risk, frequently occurring, low cost, etc. For example, a request (to change a password, to install an additional software application onto a particular workstation, to relocate some items of desktop equipment) or maybe just a question requesting information. The scale and frequent, low-risk nature of these ITIL Service Requests means that they are better handled by a separate process, the ITIL Request Fulfilment process. In the eTOM approach, the eTOM is updated to adopt the ITIL terms for incidents and problems and to include explicit reference to these, whether in an IT or business context.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Linkage with eTOM process areas<o:p></o:p></B></FONT></FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>ITIL Incident Management relates to several eTOM process areas.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The eTOM processes affected include</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Within Operations: Process Identifier: 1.1.1</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Element: Customer Relationship Management</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Impact: Where ITIL Incident Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Customer Relationship Management processes operate in line with this.
