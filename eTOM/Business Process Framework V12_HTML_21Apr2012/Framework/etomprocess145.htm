<H2>(2) eTOM Process Type Business Development</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.3.1.2</H3>
<H3>Category: (2) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Broaden the scope of the enterprise activities through expansion, or sharpening of the enterprise’s focus through divestment or outsourcing of non-critical activities.
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
Business Development processes develop concepts for new revenue streams, diversification of revenue streams and focusing or broadening of the customer base via investigating new markets, as well as different products and services for the enterprise. The focus is on broadening the scope of the enterprise activities through expansion, or sharpening the enterprise focus through divestment or outsourcing of non-critical activities. The Marketing &amp; Offer Management processes are responsible for the development of markets and products within the existing scope of the enterprise. Business Development processes understand what processes are critical to the identity of the enterprise as priority processes and look for higher quality and lower cost solutions for these high priority processes. In many cases, these processes would identify the opportunity for a ‘surgical’ outsourcing of a function or process that is not a priority of the enterprise, or is a process the enterprise cannot deliver at competitive benchmarks. Business Development processes are closely related to Strategic Planning. To realize certain enterprise strategies, Business Development processes manage investigation of potential merger and acquisition options and facilitate negotiation and implementation of mergers or acquisitions.
