<H2>(2) eTOM Process Type ITIL Continual Service Improvement</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.3.3.14</H3>
<H3>Category: (2) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is defined within ITIL. Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for CSI (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.

Note that while there may be a central focus for CSI within an organization, typically the activities to improve should form part of everyone’s roles.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Everyone within the organization needs to be empowered to suggest improvement ideas and those who actually run the processes or areas of business affected by an Improvement activity should be expected to implement the solutions.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>Terminology<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></B></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>The use of “Service” in ITIL is more general than the usage within the Business Process Framework. ITIL Service can be mapped to Service or Product within the Business Process Framework, depending on the context and focus of the delivered capability. Typically, ITIL services delivered internally in an enterprise (say, between departments) will map to Service, while those delivered externally (to the enterprise’s customers) will map to Product.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>Linkage with eTOM process areas<o:p></o:p></FONT></FONT></B></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Identifier: 1.3.3</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Element: Enterprise Effectiveness Management</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Impact: The Enterprise Effectiveness Management process grouping focuses on defining and providing the tools, methodologies and training to ensure that the enterprise processes and activities are managed and run efficiently and effectively, and can manage this in line with the ITIL context of Continual Service Improvement (CSI), where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Identifier: 1.3.3.1</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Element: Process Management &amp; Support</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Impact: Where ITIL Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Process Management &amp; Support processes operate in line with this, so that process design, change, etc, are then aligned with the ITIL approach.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>In ITIL Continual Service Improvement, the intent is that all parts of an enterprise seek to improve services and service management processes, based on formalising and documenting process responsibilities and ownership, and suitable metrics to measure and evaluate the services concerned, including the relationship with underlying technologies, etc, as well as the processes involved. ITIL Continual Service Improvement aims to review, analyse and recommend improvements in all these areas, with the overall goal of improving both cost effectiveness for the services concerned and the customer satisfaction of the service users. The general role of the Process Management &amp; Support processes is consistent with these goals, and ITIL Continual Service Improvement acts to focus how these Process Management &amp; Support operate, and to provide requirements for this.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Identifier: 1.3.3.2</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Element: Enterprise Quality Management</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Impact: Where ITIL Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Enterprise Quality Management processes operate within this, so that quality management policies and how these are applied throughout the Enterprise are then aligned with the ITIL approach.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Identifier: 1.3.3.4</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Element: Enterprise Performance Assessment</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Impact: Where ITIL Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Enterprise Performance Assessment processes operate in line with this, so that process monitoring and assessment, etc, are then aligned with the ITIL approach.</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Identifier: 1.2.1.5</FONT></P><P style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in" class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2 face=Arial>Process Element: Product &amp;
