<H2>(3) eTOM Process Type Establish &amp; Terminate Customer Relationship</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.1.1.9.1</H3>
<H3>Category: (3) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Verify the customer identity, manage the customer identity across the Enterprise, and manage termination as appropriate
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The purpose of this process is to verify that the customer is who they claim they are. To ensure only one customer identity exists across the Enterprise, which can be referenced across the whole Enterprise and allows the customer to quickly and easily identify himself. The customer relationship is terminated only if actually appropriate, the wishes of the customer are complied with where possible, records are kept in case the relationship with the customer is re-established, legal and ethical requirements for customer information are complied with. Before establishing an identity for a new customer it is essential to check that the customer does not already have an Identity with the Enterprise. Establish and verify the Identity, issue a unique Identifier and Authentication information
<BR>Significant customer life-stage events or business decisions by the Service Provider cause one or both parties to terminate the relationship. The need for complete termination of relationships needs to be differentiated from just terminating all services. The principles behind this include the Service Provider ending a relationship only if the customer ceases to exist, or the customer is fraudulent, the Enterprise decides that it no longer wishes to do business with the customer 
<BR>This process is also used to ‘clean-up’ duplicates of customer identifying information that may exist within the organization
<BR>
<BR>Profile and preference information for terminated customer relationships is archived if acceptable to the customer. All relevant parties are informed of the ended relationship. Other processes are triggered to dismantle the customer solution and servicing arrangements as necessary.
