<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The purpose of the Track &amp; Manage Customer Problem processes is to ensure that recovery activities are assigned, coordinated and tracked efficiently, and that escalation is invoked as required for any open customer problem reports in jeopardy.

<BR> Modifying information in an existing customer problem report based on assignments;
<BR> Modifying the customer problem report status;

<BR> Monitoring the jeopardy status of open customer problem reports, and escalating customer problem reports as necessary.
<BR>
<BR>Note that some specific product and/or service components may be owned and managed by suppliers/partners.

These processes will co-ordinate all the actions necessary in order to guarantee that all tasks are finished at the appropriate time and in the appropriate sequence. The Track &amp; Manage Customer Problem processes will also inform the Close Customer Problem processes by modifying the customer problem report status to cleared when the customer problem has been resolved.
