<H2>(1) eTOM Process Type Enterprise Effectiveness Management</H2>
<H3>Process Identifier: 1.3.3</H3>
<H3>Category: (1) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The Enterprise Effectiveness Management process grouping focuses on defining and providing the tools, methodologies and training to ensure that the enterprise processes and activities are managed and run efficiently and effectively.
<BR>Any enterprise has a host of processes which are used to support the business of the enterprise and its customers and suppliers. By necessity these processes need to evolve and change over time. Process Management &amp; Support processes ensure that the enterprise has the capability to undertake this process evolution.
<BR>Across an enterprise many activities occur to expand the capability of the enterprise to deliver products, provide other facilities, deliver new processes, etc. By the nature of the enterprise these activities are complex and require a high degree of coordination, often across the enterprise. Program and project management is a key competence of an enterprise, and the Program &amp; Project Management processes establish and maintain this core competence.
<BR>Ensuring that the enterprise is both effective and efficient requires that activities undertaken are done correctly the first time. The Enterprise Quality Planning &amp; Support processes establish the quality framework to be employed within the enterprise.
<BR>Effective management requires effective measurement, and the Enterprise Performance Assessment processes provide the control framework for the establishment and management of appropriate enterprise performance measures.
<BR>Facilities Management &amp; Support processes take care of environmental aspects within the enterprise's workplace, making sure the workplace facilities are adequate to guarantee an optimal performance of the employees.
