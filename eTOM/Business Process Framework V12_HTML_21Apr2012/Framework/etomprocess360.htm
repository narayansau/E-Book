<H3>Process Identifier: 1.2.4.1.4</H3>
<H3>Category: (3) eTOM Process Type</H3>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Develop and deliver annual and multi-year supply chain business plans in support of delivery and sourcing for services, products and offers
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
The Produce Supply Chain Business Plans processes develop and deliver annual and multi-year supply chain business plans in support of delivery and sourcing for resources, services, products and outsourced capabilities that include supply chain improvement forecasts, negotiation for required levels of resources, gaining supply chain development and management, as well as supply chain commitment and executive approval for the plans. The product portfolio business plans, service business plans and resource business plans provide a primary source of obtaining a view on forecasts within the supply chain.
<BR>These processes identify alternative sourcing opportunities within the supply chain for critical items in the event of unforeseen events causing disruption. Note that the actual business continuity plans are developed within the processes defined by the Business Continuity Management process in Enterprise Management.
<BR>Forecasting of commercial transaction volumes and sourcing demand, and capturing of new approaches, are both essential to ensure that the enterprise can implement the supply chain capabilities and capacity necessary for the future sourcing needs to support customers and potential customers.
