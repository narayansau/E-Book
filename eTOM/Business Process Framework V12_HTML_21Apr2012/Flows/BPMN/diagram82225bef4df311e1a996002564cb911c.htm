Responsibilities of the Survey &amp; Analyze Service Problem processes include, but are not limited to:

· Detecting and collecting service alarm event notifications; 
· Initiating and managing service alarm event records;
· Performing service alarm event notification localization analysis; 
· Correlating and filtering service alarm event records;
· Reporting service alarm event record status changes to other processes;
· Managing service alarm event record jeopardy conditions.

Service alarm event notification analysis encompasses the identification of the service alarm event in terms of reporting entity and nature of the service alarm event. It will then analyze the service alarm events based on a number of criteria and then suppress redundant, transient or implied service alarm events by means of filtering and correlation. It includes the notification of new service alarm event records, or status changes of previously reported service alarm event records, as well as abatement messages when service alarm event records have been cleared.

The analysis will correlate service alarm event notifications to planned outage notifications to remove false service alarm event notifications arising as a result of the planned outage activity.

These processes may determine that a service alarm event notification may represent a customer impacting condition. In these circumstances this process is responsible for indicating a potential customer problem to the Problem Handling processes.  As a part of this indication this process is responsible for identifying the impacted deployed product instances associated with the service instances presenting alarm event notifications and passing this information to the Problem Handling processes.

Service alarm event record correlation and filtering encompasses the correlation of redundant, transient or implied service alarm event notifications with a specific “root cause” service alarm event notification and associated service alarm event record.

The Survey &amp; Analyze Service Problem processes might trigger a well-defined action based on specific service alarm event notification information as well as the non-arrival of service alarm event notification information after a specific time interval has elapsed.

These processes are also responsible for monitoring and triggering the appropriate action when a service alarm event record is not cleared within a pre-defined period of time."></P>
