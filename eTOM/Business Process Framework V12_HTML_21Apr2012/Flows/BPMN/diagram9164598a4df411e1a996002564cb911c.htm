Responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to:

 Initiating first-in testing using automated remote testing capabilities;
 Adding additional information to an open service trouble report based on the first-in testing;
 Scheduling, assigning and coordinating repair and restoration activities;
 Generating the respective resource trouble report creation request(s) to Create Resource Trouble Report based on specific service trouble reports;
 Initiate any final testing to confirm clearance of the service problem;
 Undertake necessary tracking of the execution progress;
 Modifying information in an existing service trouble report based on assignments;
 Modifying the service trouble report status;
 Canceling a service trouble report when the specific problem was related to a false service alarm event; and
 Monitoring the jeopardy status of open service trouble reports, and escalating service trouble reports as necessary.

Note that some specific resource components may be owned and managed by suppliers/partners.  In these cases the Track &amp; Manage Service Problem process is responsible for initiating requests, through S/P Problem Reporting &amp; Management processes for restoration and recovery by the supplier/partner of the specific resource components.
These processes will co-ordinate all the actions necessary in order to guarantee that all tasks are finished at the appropriate time and in the appropriate sequence.

The Track &amp; Manage Service Problem processes are responsible for engaging external suppliers/partners in correction and recovery activities when:
 higher level expertise and/or higher level support is required to resolve the service problem, (which may be automatic in the case of highest priority service problems);
 the specific service has been purchased from an external supplier (as in an interconnect service); or
 the specific service is delivered by an external partner.

Where the engagement with an external supplier/partner is for purchased or delivered services, as the case may be, the tracking and management of the supplier/partner problem resolution activity is actually performed by the S/P Problem Reporting &amp; Management processes, with the Track &amp; Manage Service Problem processes relegated to an overall coordination role. The Track &amp; Manage Service Problem processes will also inform the Close Service Problem processes by modifying the service trouble report status to cleared when the service problem has been resolved."></P>
