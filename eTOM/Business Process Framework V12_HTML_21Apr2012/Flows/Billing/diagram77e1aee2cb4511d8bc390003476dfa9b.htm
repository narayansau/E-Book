The end user is presented with this information, aka Advice of Charge (AoC) via a screen display, voice message, text message, etc.  This may also involve presenting relevant (to that user) alternative charges.

Example.1: A video clip of a goal scored may be more expensive in the first ½ hour after the match is played and/or follow ‘normal’ time related charging rules, eg cheaper after 18.00 hours. The AoC would display the current cost of the video clip download, plus may display the reduced cost of the video clip if the user is prepared to wait until a later time. (NB. this is down to the business rules/policy of the company concerned). 

Example.2: The download of a music CD may take 3 hours via a 500k Broadband line and cost $5 for the video and nothing for transport (covered by normal flat rate subscription), or it may take 5 minutes to download via the 500 BB line temporarily boosted to 10M and cost $5 for the video and $3 for the extra temporary bandwidth.  (NB. The charges displayed here would be decided by the company involved, but best practice would suggest both charges are displayed.)"></P>
