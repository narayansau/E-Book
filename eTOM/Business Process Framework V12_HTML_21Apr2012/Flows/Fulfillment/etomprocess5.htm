<H2>(1) eTOM Process Type Resource Management &amp; Operations</H2>
<H3>Brief Description</H3>
Maintains knowledge of resources (application, computing and network infrastructures) and is responsible for managing all these resources (e.g. networks, IT systems, servers, routers, etc.) utilized to deliver and support services required by or proposed to customers.
<H3>Extended Description</H3>
This horizontal functional process grouping maintains knowledge of resources (application, computing and network infrastructures) and is responsible for managing all these resources (e.g. networks, IT systems, servers, routers, etc.) utilized to deliver and support services required by or proposed to customers. It also includes all functionalities responsible for the direct management of all such resources (network elements, computers, servers, etc.) utilized within the enterprise. These processes are responsible for ensuring that the network and information technologies infrastructure supports the end-to-end delivery of the required services. The purpose of these processes is to ensure that infrastructure runs smoothly, is accessible to services and employees, is maintained and is responsive to the needs, whether directly or indirectly, of services, customers and employees. RM&amp;O also has the basic function to assemble information about the resources (e.g. from network elements and/or element management systems), and then integrate, correlate, and in many cases, summarize that data to pass on the relevant information to Service Management systems, or to take action in the appropriate resource.
<BR>
<BR>In an ebusiness world, application and computing management are as important as management of the network resources. Moreover, network, computing and applications resources must increasingly be managed in a joint and integrated fashion. To cope with these needs, the eTOM framework includes the Resource Management &amp; Operations process grouping (together with the corresponding Resource Development &amp; Management grouping within SIP), to provide integrated management across these three sets of resources: applications, computing and network. These areas also encompass processes involved with traditional Network Element Management, since these processes are actually critical components of any resource management process, as opposed to a separate process layer.
<BR>
<BR>The RM&amp;O processes thus manage the complete service provider network and sub-network and information technology infrastructures.
<BR>
<BR>The eTOM framework differentiates day-to-day operations and support from planning and development, and other strategy and lifecycle processes. This better depicts the structure of an enterprise, especially in an ebusiness era.
