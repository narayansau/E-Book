<H3>Extended Description</H3>
This horizontal functional process grouping focuses on the knowledge of services (Access, Connectivity, Content, etc.) and includes all functionalities necessary for the management and operations of communications and information services required by or proposed to customers. The focus is on service delivery and management as opposed to the management of the underlying network and information technology. Some of the functions involve short-term service capacity planning for a service instance, the application of a service design to specific customers or managing service improvement initiatives. These functions are closely connected with the day-to-day customer experience.
<BR>The processes in this horizontal functional process grouping are accountable to meet, at a minimum, targets set for Service Quality, including process performance and customer satisfaction at a service level, as well as Service Cost.
<BR>The eTOM framework differentiates day-to-day operations and support from planning and development and other strategy and lifecycle processes. This better depicts the structure of an enterprise, especially in an ebusiness era.
